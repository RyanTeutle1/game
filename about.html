        <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi, My name is Ryan Teutle and I am the Researcher and Developer behind this game, I am a student at the Engineering and Science University Magnet School in New Haven, some of my favorite games growing up were the nintendo mario franchise, whether it be the older games such as Super Mario World for the SNES or the newer variations.</p> 
      <h2>Game Evaluation</h2>
      <p> When I think of a game's definition I like to think that a game is something which can be played with others or by yourself, whether it be for fun or for a challenging experience. Games are meant to be entertaining and they serve that purpose to bring you joy and happiness while you play them.</p>
      <h2>My Gamer Types</h2>
      <p> When I took the Bartle test I answered some questions and in the end my results came out, 'ASEK' which stands for Achiever, Socialiser, Explorer, and Killer. I tested a higher percentage for Achiever which connects players to their games that they play, me specifically I enjoy striving for the better things in a game, whether it be collecting the most equipment or completeing something to completion.</p>
